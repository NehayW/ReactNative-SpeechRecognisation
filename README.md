# ReactNative-SpeechRecognition

Standard Module SpeechRecognition

SpeechRecognition is a module that will recognize your voice and give text suggestion based on your speech. In this project I have used a @react-native-voice/voice library. It will used a google speech recognition. So record permission is mandatory to provide to google app as well as to your project also.
